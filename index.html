        Task<br>
        The function pickIt accepts 1 parameter, arr, which is an array of numbers. We need to traverse arr by using a for loop. <br>
        If an element is an odd number, push it to the odd array, and if it's an even number, push it to the evenarray.<br>
        <br>
        I've defined two arrays odd and even in the function, and also wrote the return statement. Your work is to write a for loop.<br>
